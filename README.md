# SiameseShiftNet  
NN predicting spatial coregistration shift of remote sensing imagery.  
Predicts and applies X and Y affine transforms based on a 128x128 center crop of the input images, which have been encoded separately. Encodings are calculated based on all bands and represented as a single channel encoding.
